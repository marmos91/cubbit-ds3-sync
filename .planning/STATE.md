# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Files sync reliably and transparently between the user's Mac and Cubbit DS3, with zero friction
**Current focus:** Phase 2 -- Sync Engine (metadata foundation complete, SyncEngine next)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (Sync Engine)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase (02-01 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-12 -- Completed plan 02-01 (metadata foundation)

Progress: [####......] 38%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 9 min
- Total execution time: 0.7 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation | 4 | 37 min | 9 min |
| 2. Sync Engine | 1 | 7 min | 7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 10m, 9m, 9m, 7m
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Correctness-first ordering (foundation -> sync engine -> conflict resolution -> auth/platform -> UX)
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (Auth & Platform) depends only on Phase 1, enabling potential parallelism
- Plan 01-01: Converted DS3Lib from Xcode framework target to local SPM package
- Plan 01-01: Removed project-level SotoS3 and swift-collections SPM deps (now in DS3Lib/Package.swift)
- Plan 01-01: Simplified CI workflow to direct DS3Drive scheme build with CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
- Plan 01-02: Two log subsystems (io.cubbit.DS3Drive for app+lib, io.cubbit.DS3Drive.provider for extension)
- Plan 01-02: Six log categories (sync, auth, transfer, extension, app, metadata) for Console.app filtering
- Plan 01-02: decodedKey() helper for safe percent decoding in S3Lib (no force-unwraps)
- Plan 01-03: Guard-let chain init pattern -- every extension method uses local bindings after enabled check
- Plan 01-03: S3ErrorType.toFileProviderError() maps to specific NSFileProviderError codes for system retry behavior
- Plan 01-03: Multipart upload validates ETag and aborts orphaned parts on any failure
- Plan 01-04: @MainActor on MetadataStore instead of Sendable (ModelContainer not Sendable)
- Plan 01-04: syncStatus stored as String for SwiftData compat, type-safe accessor via computed property
- Plan 01-04: Disabled force_unwrapping in SwiftLint due to pre-existing patterns
- Plan 02-01: MetadataStore converted to @ModelActor actor with static createContainer() factory
- Plan 02-01: SyncAnchorRecord defined inside SyncedItemSchemaV2 enum (SwiftData requirement)
- Plan 02-01: Tests use ManagedAtomic<Int> for Sendable-safe counters in Swift 6

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [RESOLVED] File Provider extensions are hard to debug -- OSLog structured logging now in place (plan 01-02)
- [RESOLVED] SwiftData with concurrent File Provider extension processes -- MetadataStore now uses @ModelActor for background-safe access (plan 02-01, upgraded from @MainActor in 01-04)
